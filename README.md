# PySaha: a Saha ionization equation solver for Python.

Python implementation of the Saha ionization equation to solve ionic populations for monocomponent plasmas in local thermal equilibrium. Atomic energy structure obtained using FACOF interface of FAC.

Corrections due to plasma environment to the isolated atomic levels are included as a static correction to the ionization energy.
